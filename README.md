# HTR and Line Segmentation Model Project

**Developed by Sidharth Salugu (23R11A6641), Sadaf Firoz (23R11A67D6) and Samar Sunhith Kumar (23R11A6646)** for **Cantilever Internship**.  

This application demonstrates the potential of **Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR)** to transform handwritten images into **digital text** for storage and modification.

> **Note**: This is a demonstration project developed for internship purposes. Not intended for complex production use.

## Project Overview
Our goal is to build and demonstrate a working HTR application using deep learning. This serves as a practical illustration of how HTR technology can solve real-world problems of digitizing handwritten documentation.

## Models Used

1. **HTR Model**:  
   [TrOCR-Base-Handwritten](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/trocr-base-handwritten) (Microsoft)


2. **Line Segmentation Model**:  
   [YOLOv9-Lines-Within-Regions](https://huggingface.co/Riksarkivet/yolov9-lines-within-regions-1) (Riksarkivet)
